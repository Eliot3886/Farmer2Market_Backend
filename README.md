# 🌾 Farmer2Market - Backend API

## 📌 Overview
Farmer2Market is a backend API built to connect farmers directly with buyers, reducing middlemen and improving market access for small-scale farmers.

This project is built using **Django**, **Django REST Framework**, **JWT Authentication**, and **PostgreSQL**.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Backend Framework: Django
- API Layer: Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Language: Python

---

## 🚀 Features
- User registration and login (JWT authentication)
- Secure token-based authentication
- RESTful API endpoints
- Product listing (farm produce)
- Basic business logic for marketplace operations
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Clean and modular Django architecture

---

## 🔐 Authentication
This project uses JWT Authentication.

After login, a token is generated and must be included in requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```
